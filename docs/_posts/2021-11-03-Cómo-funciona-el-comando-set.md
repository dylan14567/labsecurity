The ```set``` command is a command that allows us to select something specific, but we must think that ```set``` means to select in order to have an idea of how that command would work.

For example, if we want to select a target we would have to use the ```set``` command and then place ```target```:

```shell
set target 127.0.0.1
```

In this way we will have selected the objective. The ip that has been selected is after the ```target```, when we use ```target``` in ```set``` we are indicating that what is going to be selected is a target such as an ip or a host.

And in the end the ip will have been stored in the ```target``` variable and we can check that by executing the same command since we will get a message and that indicates that the target was stored in the variable.

If we wanted to select a port we would have to use the command ```set``` and then ```port``` since we specify that we are going to select a port by putting ```set port``` and an example would be ```set port 80``` where we would be selecting port 80.
