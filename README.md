Labsecurity is a tool that bundles ethical hacking python scripts into a single tool with cli interface.

positional arguments:
  script_name           Script name to be executed

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TARGET, --target TARGET
                        Objective to use
  -p PORT, --port PORT  Port to user
```

## üìö Use

To use this tool you must learn the following concept:

```shell
python3 labsecurity.py -t http://example.com scanweb.py
```
 
By using the ```-t``` parameter I specify the target which in this case is ```http://example.com``` and by putting ```scanweb.py``` at the end I specify the script to be executed. The scripts are located in the ```/scripts``` folder and can be used in the tool.

Another example would be using another script that in this case will be ```scanport.py```:

```shell
python3 labsecurity.py -t 192.168.0.107 -p 80 scanport.py
```

In this case, apart from the ```-t``` parameter, the ```-p``` parameter is added to specify the port and at the end the ```scanport.py``` script is used to scan said port.

You can see the available scripts and their function with the following command:

```shell
python3 labsecurity.py show-options.py
```

## üíª What can labsecurity do?

* You can scan a public ip
